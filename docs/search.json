The gist of the site is to capture the projects and skills that i am currently working on and document them as i keep on learning as well as to write up on topics that i find fascinating.\nThere are lot sections that i have added to the site to keep myself accountable and motivated to keep posting on this site, the current goal is to populate all the sections decently enough by 2023 mid.\nFeel free to jump to any of the above sections.(Most of the sections are work in progress but eventually everything will be in order)\nHappy exploring !!!\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."

    "title": "Quantitative finance resources",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Quantitative finance is vast field with lot many resources available. Many would agree these resources would help one get a job and be at intermediate level in terms of expertise, while becoming a expert is still sort of restricted to learning on the job. But can one ever become an expert in any chosen topic within Quantitative finance or even for that matter get to an intermediate level of understanding of various topics within the field.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most difficult decisions that I had to make while venturing into this field was choose a book to read or videos to watch and stick to it without regretting later that it wasn’t enough or worse I chose the wrong resource. Educating oneself for the purpose of research in purely theoretical field is far more simple, you know for sure the list of prerequistes for the topic , the books that you need to master the topic, current and past important research papers you need to read and research work by list of researchers you need to follow voilà you are close to becoming an expert in the field given of course you have had comprehensive understanding of the topic which you are able explain with relative ease. A researcher lets say in the field of pure mathematics doesnt care whether his research is going to be relevant in next 10 years or 20 years,for him the joy lies in solving the problem and coming up with innovative solution , it hardly matters whether his research topic will be relevant for he has gained a level of expertise to such an extent that such a thing were ever to bother him he would just shift his focus in a closely related field(assuming there is always a closely related field) of relevance with minimal difficulty and at time same time continue doing research on the topic and hoping there would be someone who might pursue it further later on.\nThis approach of the researcher I think is the best way to move forward in learning any topic. Make yourself an expert in the basics of the field and you are free to move around without the overhead of being relevant or for that matter employable. To worry about whether the resource you have chosen to master a topic is enough or not gets you no where. \nThere are lot many topics within the field of quantitative finance for one to come closer to becoming an expert.\nOn the internet you will find lot many articles listing resources based on each topic. In the end they even go on to say the list is not exhaustive making even more difficult to choose. I think its nearly impossible to cover that many books( they could just be resources for reference but that’s hardly ever the tone of those articles) in any reasonable amount of time.\nYou can refer to the resources section up top for list of all books , articles , youtube video that I have come across over the period of time. Here I have just listed down couple of books on each topic and contents of each topics that one needs to master(based on job description for almost any type of quantitative role) and that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time(give yourself a year or six months if you are really comfortable with the math ). I have included books that are at times quite math heavy since I prefer them more and I have a background(Masters) in pure(non-applicable) mathematics. I would suggest to get comfortable with math for it becomes easier in manipulating models and creating new ones from the existing models without much effort. This is particularly true in this field as one proceeds with the assumption that all models are wrong, math would help you in converging to the reality (ironically).Try to implement the mathematical topics in a programming language of your choice instead of postponing it.\nHere is the list of resources that I am currently reading and following:\n\nStatistics and probability\nA. Topics\n\nProbability and distributions (All the common and standard distributions)\nMultivariate distributions\nStastical inference\nMaximum likelikhood methods\nSufficiency\nGeneralised linear models\nLimiting Distributions\nOptimal tests of hypothesis\nNon parametric and robust statistics\n\nB. Books and videos\n\nIntroudction to mathematical statistics by Hogg ,Mckean and Craig\nMathematical theory of Bayesian Mathematics by Sumio Watanabe\nStatistics for Application by Philippe Rigollet (Youtube video - MIT OCW)\n\nMachine learning and deep learning\nA. Topics\n\nSupervised learning algorithms\nUnsupervised Learning Algorithms\nAdvanced learning algorithims\n\nB Books and Videos\n\n[Theory]Probabilistic Machine learning Book 1 by Kevin Murphy\n[Theory]Understanding Machine learning theory algorithims\nISLR[Introduction to statistical learnign - good for R implementation] and ESL[Elements of statistical learning- Bible of Statistical Learning] by Hastie and Tibshirani\n[Implementation] Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Kera & Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron\n[Bonus Implementation] Machine Learing in C++ by Kiril Kolodiazhnyi\n[Coursera - Deep Learning.ai - Andrew Ng] Machine Learning Specialization(This course enough for all intents and purposes unless you wish to delve deeper)\n\nStochastic calculus[An absolute on Sell Side]\nA. Topics\n\nMeasure theoretic Probability\nBrownian Motion\nIto’s Integral [the most important subtopic]\nIto-Doeblin Formula\nLevy Process and Jump Process\nChange of Numeraire\nTerm Structure Models\n\nB. Books and videos\n\nStochastic Calculus for finance II by Steven E Shreve [This is enough for all intents and purposes]\nMathematical Modeling and computation in finance by Cornelis W Oosterlee and Lech A Grezelak (You can find videos which follow the book by the later author on you tube making it one of the most approachable resource on the Topic) I would sugget to go through this text once before you go for Shreve’s book. Shreve’s book extensively makes use of Measure Theory(though not in a great detail I would like but more than sufficient for the purpose )\nPricing options with Mathematical Models (Not that detailed in Math but great course on coursera neverthless )\n\nMathematics relevant for finance\nFinancial products (Mostly Options)\nProgramming tools\nA. Topics\nScientific Computing\nTradFi(Traditional Finance)"
