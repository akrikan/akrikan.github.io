The gist of the site is to capture the projects and skills that i am currently working on and document them as I keep on learning as well as to write up on topics that i find fascinating.\nThere are lot sections that i have added to the site to keep myself accountable and motivated to keep posting on this site, the current goal is to populate all the sections decently enough by 2023 mid.\nFeel free to jump to any of the above sections.(Most of the sections are work in progress but eventually everything will be in order)\nHappy exploring !!!\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
