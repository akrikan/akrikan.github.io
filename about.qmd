Hi , I am Krishnakant Ammanamanchi , welcome to my Site/Blog or whatever.

I am unsure what to call this anymore. The gist of the site is to capture the projects and skills that i am currently working on and document them as i keep on learning.

Feel free to jump to any of the above sections.(Most of the sections are work in progress but eventually everything will be in order)

Happy exploring !!!

This is a Quarto website.
