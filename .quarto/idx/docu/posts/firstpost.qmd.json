But can one ever become\nan expert in any chosen topic within Quantitative finance or even for\nthat matter get to an intermediate level of understanding of various\ntopics within the field.\n\n<!-- Research education is far more clear in terms of becoming an expert.There is definite list of resources available for one to master which coupled with reading and and publishing high quality research papers pushes one to the top.Any choice of standard book in the field of  let's say Algebraic geometry one can easily find out the pre-requistes , the standard books to complete or courses to undertake  and list of researchers to follow , at the same time devoting enough time to research personally and one can say depending on the research or the capability to explain each topic with ease whether  one is close to becoming a expert or not.That is to say one can decide with great ease whether one is an expert or not.and this possibility of clarity was one of the  many things  that had pushed me towards pursuing research in a purely theoretical research field knowing one day i could become one myself. Though I didnt pursue it and thats another matter. -->\n\n<!-- I find that sort of clarity lacks in the field of quantitative finance. There is no consensus on what is essential and one is forced to choose very early on what kind of role one wishes to pursue  within this field. The job description for majority of quantitative roles are absolutely unclear and even if one were to master each and every topic  that could ever come up in any job description there is still no guarantee  that in the end at the job that  you would ever to make use most of  the things that were in the  job description, similar to DSA being asked in interviews for software engineering roles while at the job the hired engineer majority of the time writing packages , re-factoring code and testing where he hardly gets to implement the things that he was interviewed on. -->\n\n<!-- Lets say we convince ourselves that the field is new and its impact and role within finance yet to be decisively determined hence recruiters try to find a candidate who knows almost everything at least at the basic level  closely related with the field which is reflected in the job description and  with a certain background . So that he can make use of knowledge he has in a  way to tackle and solve a problem at hand. -->\n\n<!-- ### -->\n\nOne of the most difficult decisions that I had to make while venturing\ninto this field was choose a book to read or videos to watch and stick\nto it without regretting later that it wasn't enough or worse I chose\nthe wrong resource. Educating oneself for the purpose of research in\npurely theoretical field is far more simple, you know for sure the list\nof prerequistes for the topic , the books that you need to master the\ntopic, current and past important research papers you need to read and\nresearch work by list of researchers you need to follow voil√† you are\nclose to becoming an expert in the field given of course you have had\ncomprehensive understanding of the topic which you are able explain with\nrelative ease. \n\nMake yourself an expert in the basics of the\nfield and you are free to move around without the overhead of being\nrelevant or for that matter employable. To worry about whether the\nresource you have chosen to master a topic is enough or not gets you no\nwhere.\n<!-- Surely one can make a case where one builds up expertise one single topic and follow a similar path to that of research education. But the primary motivation is fundamentally different. In the former becoming an expert may give the same joy and satisfaction that a rese -->\n\nThere are lot many topics within the field of quantitative finance for\none to come closer to becoming an expert.\n\nOn the internet you will find lot many articles listing resources based\non each topic. In the end they even go on to say the list is not\nexhaustive making even more difficult to choose. I think its nearly\nimpossible to cover that many books( they could just be resources for\nreference but that's hardly ever the tone of those articles) in any\nreasonable amount of time.\n\nYou can refer to the resources section up top for list of all books , articles , youtube video that I have come across over the period of time(yet to populate the section) . Here I have just listed down couple of books on each topic\nand contents of each topics that one needs to master(based on job\ndescription for almost any type of quantitative role) and that can be\ncompleted in a reasonable amount of time(give yourself a year or six months if you are really comfortable with the math ). I have included books that are\nat times quite math heavy since I prefer them more and I have a\nbackground(Masters) in pure(non-applicable) mathematics. I would suggest\nto get comfortable with math for it becomes easier fine-tuning\nmodels and creating new ones from the existing models without much\neffort. This is particularly true in this field as one proceeds with the\nassumption that all models are wrong, math would help you in converging\nto the reality (ironically).Try to implement the mathematical topics in a programming language of your choice instead of postponing it.\n\nHere is the list of resources that I am currently reading and following:\n\n1.  Statistics and probability\n\n    A. Topics\n\n      * Probability and distributions (All the common and standard distributions) \n      * Multivariate distributions\n      * Stastical inference\n      * Maximum likelikhood methods\n      * Sufficiency\n      * Generalised linear models\n      * Limiting Distributions\n      * Optimal tests of hypothesis\n      * Non parametric and robust statistics\n      \n\n    B.

Books and videos\n        \n      * Stochastic Calculus for finance II by Steven E Shreve [This is enough for all intents and purposes] but if you are interested in Levy processes than you might have to refer to another book.\n      * Mathematical Modeling and computation in finance by Cornelis W Oosterlee and Lech A Grezelak (You can find videos which follow the book by the later author on you tube making it one of the most approachable resource on the topic) I would sugget to go through this text once, before you go for Shreve's book. Shreve's book extensively makes use of Measure Theory.Great theoretical and practical book. I personally use this book and shreve's book for refernce. TO be honest no stochastic calculus for finance book actually is self contained, many theorems are referenced.\n      * Pricing options with Mathematical Models (great course on coursera ) from Caltech.\n      \n\n      \n\n4.
