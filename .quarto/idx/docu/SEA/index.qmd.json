{"title":"Sea of Everything","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Sea of Everything"},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nInspired by the Rising Sea : Foundations of algebriac geomtery By Professor Ravi Vakil , which covers pretty much everything one needs to master Algebraic geometry. I have titled this section as Sea of Everything where I would be covering all my current interests related to fields of financial mathematics,programming , machine learning , crypto , etc...\n\nMy Home page would host articles that I have written to explain myself the inner - working of an idea or a concept and which are fascinating enough to be highlighted amidst all of this.\n\nThe current direction of this ***section*** mostly looks like combination of notes and insights.\n\nI have included my hand written notes for few sections. I would be adding hand written notes and expand them as I keep on coming across various subtopics within the subject.\n\nInitially I had the plan to type the content but given my current over demanding job, I have decided to keep a mix of both written and typed sections.\n\nApologies for my handwriting it's terrible I know.\n\nP.S - It looks like my initial aim was quite ambitious given the timeframe I set for myself. I originally planned to organize the content on my website in a very structured manner, starting with preliminaries and then moving on to the main topics. However, I've realized that this approach has been quite time-consuming. Therefore, I've decided to focus on including mostly definitions and important information regarding topics in the SEA section. I plan to merge the Implementations section with SEA in the future, but for now, they will remain separate. The current outline of the website represents my vision, but as I add content, I will adjust the structure as needed.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","jupyter":"python3","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"toc-location":"right","title":"Sea of Everything"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
