title: "Resources"
abstract: This page contains every form of resource I have come across while learning and studying various topics in all fields that interest me, not specifically restricted to quantitative finance. Initially, I thought of maintaining this page on Notion, like many others, since visualizing and editing is easier there, but I have chosen against it.
