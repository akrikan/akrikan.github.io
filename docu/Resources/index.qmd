title: "Resources"
abstract: This page basically contains every form of resource that I have come across while learning and studying various topics in all fields that interest me , not specifically restricted to quantitative finance. Initially I had thought of maintaing this whole page on notion like majority of others given visualising and editing is easier but I have chosen against it.
