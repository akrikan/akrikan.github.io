title: "Resources(Mostly Twitter S/S)"
editor: visual

This page basically contains twitter threads screen shots , there is no easy way to save twitter threads on twitter and save them or at least i haven't bothered to search for a solution ,so anyways would be including it here

As of now I haven't categorized it and maybe in future will add links and reviews to various resources which i have found useful over time.

The date, time and twitter_handle is included in the screen-shot so you can go ahead and search for it , I have not purposefully included them the links since many a times the author deletes the tweets and it becomes a headache to revist dead-links and remove them , trying to keep it simple here.
