  title: "Stochastic Calculus"
  abstract: Would be including the notes and topics from Shreve's book as well topics that would fall into this topic. Will be only including theory , the practical and implementation part woulld be on a different page and that would be bifurcated further based on the programming language. C++ is currently the frontrunner but since visualization is easier in Python i would be writing code for that as well.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER THERE IS AT TIMES LOT OF HAND WAVING ,THIS IS NOT AS MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT LIKE IN A PURE MATH TEXTBOOK.

## Resources

This are list of books , videos and courses that I am currently referencing for content on this page , for more detailed list please check out the resource section above.

## Learning approach

I would be going with top - down approach rather than a bottoms-up approach, a quicker way surely would be sacrificing some important theorems along the way if they are not used in any models , but for all practical purposes bottoms-up approach with a full time job is time consuming and I would have to wait almost a year to even see models and implementation going by that route.

## General Probability theory

::: {#def-sigma}
## $\sigma$ algebra

: Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set , and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of collections of subsets of $\Omega$. We say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$ algebra provided that

i)  The empty set $\emptyset$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}$
ii) $A$ and $A^{c}$ belong to $\mathcal{F}$ whenever A $\in$ $\mathcal{F}$
iii) whenever $$A_1 ,A_2 ,A_3 ..... \in \mathcal{F}$$ then $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_{i} \in \mathcal{F}$

::: {#def-ProbMeasure}
## Probability measure

: Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set , and let $\mathbb{F}$ be $\sigma$ algebra of subsets of $\Omega$. A probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ is a function that, to every set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ , assigns a number in $[0,1]$ called the probability of $A$ written as $\mathbb{P}(A)$ .We require

i)  $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$ and

ii) (Countable Additivity) Whenever $A_1,A_2,A_3....$ is a sequence of disjoint sets in $\mathcal{F}$ , then $$\mathbb{P}(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(A_n) $$

<br/> The Triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{}P)$ is called probability measure
:::

<br/> From the above it follows that for finitely many disjoint sets $A_1, A_2,A_3....A_n$ $$\mathbb{P}(\bigcup_{n=1}^N) = \sum_{n=1}^N \mathbb{P}(A_n)$$

and $\mathbb{P}(A^c) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A)$

## Uniform(Lebesgue) measure on $[0,1]$

<br/> $\Omega = [0,1]$<br/> $\mathbb{P}[a,b] = b-a ,0 \leq a \leq b \leq1$ <br/> single points have zero probability and <br/> $(a,b)$ can be written as $$ \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty[a+\frac{1}{n} , b -\frac{1}{n}]$$
:::

<br/> <br/> The $\sigma$-algebra beginning with closed intervals and adding everything else necessary in order to have a $\sigma$- algebra is called a Borel $\sigma$-algebra and denoted by $\mathcal{B}[0,1]$. Borel $\sigma$-algebras are $\sigma$-algebra generated by open sets and equivalently closed sets over any topological space.




::: {#def-almostsurely}

let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ be a probability space. If a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}(A) = 1$, we say the event $A$ occurs almost surely

Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the uniform measure as defined in example 1. Define $X(\omega) = \omega$ and $Y(\omega) = 1 - \omega$ for all $\omega \in [0,1]$ , then the distribution measure of X is uniform $$\mu_{X}[a,b] = \mathbb{P}\{\omega;a\leq X(w)\leq b\} = \mathbb{P}[a,b] = b-a, 0\leq a \leq b \leq 1$$ by definition of $\mathbb{P}$. <br/>
Its easy to see to see that $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution.
But under the probability measure$\mathbb{\widetilde{P}}$ on $[0,1]$ defined by $$\mathbb{\widetilde{P}[a,b]} = \int_a^b 2\omega \, d\omega = b^2-a^2  , 0 \leq a\leq b \leq1 $$ $X$ and $Y$ have different distributions.

::: {#def-CDF}
## cumulative distribution function and density function

$$ F(x) = \mathbb{P}\{X \leq x\} , x \in \mathbb{R}$$
$$\mu_X[a,b] = \mathbb{P}\{a \leq X \leq b \} = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx , -\infty < a \leq b < \infty$$ $f(x)$ is called the density funtion and $F(x)$ is called the cummulative distribution function.

## Standard normal random variable
Let $$\phi(x)  = \frac {a}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}$$ be the standard normal density and definiing the cummulative normal distribution function as $$N(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \phi(\xi)\,d\xi$$ The function $N(x)$ is strictly increasing function which is surjective onto $(0,1)$ from $\mathbb{R}$, so it has a strictly increasing inverse function $N^{-1}(y),y \in (0,1)$. Let $Y$ be a uniformly distributed random variable defined  on some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ and set $X = N^{-1}(Y)$ then 


\begin{align*}

\mu_X[a,b] &= \mathbb{P}\{\omega \in \Omega ; a \leq X(\omega) \leq b\} \\

          &= \mathbb{P}\{\omega \in \Omega ; a \leq N^{-1}(Y(\omega)) \leq b\}\\
            
          &= \mathbb{P}\{\omega \in \Omega ; N(a) \leq Y(\omega) \leq N(b) \} \\
        
          &= N(b) - N(a) \\
          &= \int_a^b \phi(x) \, dx

\end{align*}


Any random variable that has this distribution regardless of the probability space is called standard normal distribution.<br/>
Thing to note the use of uniformly distributed random variable for generating a standard random variable is called probability integral transform and this is commonly used in Monte Carlo simulation
