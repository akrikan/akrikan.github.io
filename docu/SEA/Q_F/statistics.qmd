## Introduction
## Standard Definitions
<u>Expected Value</u> $\mathbb{E}[X]$ is given by

$$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f(x) dx$$
<u>Variance</u>$Var(X)$ is given by


$$Var(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{{E(X)}^2}$$
<u>Higher Moments</u> $\mathbb{E}(X^n)$ is given by

$$\mathbb{E}(X^n) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^n f(x) dx$$

## Distributions

### Normal Distribution

A random variable $X$ is said to be normally distrbuted if it has a probability density function as follows

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-{\frac{1}{2}}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$

It is a continous probability distribution

$\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and variance of the distribution respectively

The case where $\mu =0$ and $\sigma = 1$ is called standard normal distribution and its PDF is given by $$  f(x) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}$$


### Log Normal Distibution 

A random Variable $X$ is said to have log normal distibution if $Y = \ln{X}$ and $Y$ is normally distributed.

The PDF of log normal distribution is given by 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{(-\frac{(\ln{x} -\mu)^2}{2{\sigma}^2})}$$ where $\mu$ and  $\sigma$ are the mean and variance of $Y(\ln X)$ respectively.

Hence the mean $\mu^*$ and variance $\sigma^*$ of X are as follows


$$\mu^* = e^{\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}$$
$$\sigma^* = e^{2\mu + 2\sigma^2} - e^{2\mu +\sigma^2}$$
Important thing to note here is that  $x$ can take values in $(0,\infty)$ only.
