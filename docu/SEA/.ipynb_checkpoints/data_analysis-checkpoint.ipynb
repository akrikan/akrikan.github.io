    "List of important libraries and tools that are mainly used for data analysis in python\n",
    "* Numpy: Numerical Python has great array processing capabilities. Mostly used to pass data to algorithims from datasets/libraries. It gives the ability to perform linear algebra operations ,Fourier transforms with ease. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas: Mostly used to manipulate and create new data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Matplotlib: Used for plots and other two dimensional data visualizations \n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter: Commonly used for testing , running iterations, debugging before sending off the code to production. Jupyter notebook supports R , python and julia programming languages as well as markdown for documenting the files\n",
    "\n",
    "* SciPy: Scientific computing library. Provides functionality to integrate , optimise , signal processing,etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "* Scikit-learn: The library has machine learning models which can be used out of the box. Has all the standard machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above tools and libraries are very well documented and navigating through them is relatively easy.\n"
