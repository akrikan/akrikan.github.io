Hi, I’m Krishnakant Ammanamanchi. Welcome to my site/blog (or whatever you prefer to call it).

The purpose of this site is to showcase the projects and skills I’m currently working on, document my learning journey, and share posts on topics I find fascinating.

I’ve added several sections to keep myself accountable and motivated to keep posting. My goal is to have all sections well-populated in due course.

Feel free to explore any section. (Most sections are still a work in progress, but everything will eventually be in order.)

Happy exploring!

This is a Quarto website.
